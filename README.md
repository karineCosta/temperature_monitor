# Temperature Monitor (Python Simulation)

This is a beginner-friendly project that simulates a basic temperature monitoring system using Python.  
It mimics how an industrial sensor might behave when checking temperature values over time.

## 🔍 What it does

- Simulates 10 temperature readings from an industrial machine
- Generates random temperature values between 60°C and 85°C
- Checks if the temperature exceeds the safe limit (75°C)
- Displays warnings when temperatures are too high

## 🛠 Technologies used

- Python 3
- Built-in libraries: `random`, `time`

## 🧠 Why this project?

It helped me practice:
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Time delays
- Console output formatting
